# Why this addon exists:

This plugin was once part of my project Raigon, which is closed source. 

After watching a YouTube video (that if I ever find, will link it here), I decided to start compartmentalizing my project into smaller ones that I can reuse.

With that said, I am working toward making this a drop in level system for on-rails shooter games that also support free-ranged combat


# How to install:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/BradGaddis/rail-level-system
```

Unfortunately, I haven't yet decoupled this from other systems that I have in my game, but, for now, you can clone them in recursively.
